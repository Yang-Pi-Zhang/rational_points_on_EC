# rational.h
The class of arbitrarily long integers and rational numbers with numerator and denominator with arbitrary length. Includes many basic arithmetics.

# ECCurve.h
The class of cubic curves and the struct of straight lines on Q^2. The class of cubic curves contains some initializing functions and the computation of the tangent line at a point, and also the algorithm to derive the third intersection point of the curve with the tangent. For the mathematical background of this derivation, please see computation.tex and computation.pdf.

# test.h
Contains several testing function on integers, rationals and elliptic curves. The testing function of integers (resp. ) tests the functionality of the arithmetic of integers (resp. rationals). The testing function of elliptic curves computes some rational points on the explicit cubic curve X^3+Y^3-1141=0 with starting point (20,-19).
